			If you search for software development methodologies you will be able to find comprehensive lists with extensive descriptions. 
			There has been a lot written, still I could not find a single source that would look at the topic from the customer's point of view. 
			By customer I mean the company or organization that wants to develop e.g. an application, whether it is them who will use it or not.
			This is software development with the eyes of the customer. At least those methodologies that are worth mentioning.

			Do you know a website or an article that looks at software development from the customer point of view?

				Waterfall is used when all requirements are 100% clear before any development starts. <br>
				<br>
				The water then falls through the following steps: <br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Requirements (from customer to supplier)<br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Development and testing against requirement (by supplier)<br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Testing of implemented changed (by customer but ideally by end-users - can get hands on before release)<br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Regression testing (by customer - the goal is to find what got broken by implementing changes)	<br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bug fixing (Supplier)	<br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Smoke test <br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Release	<br>
				<br>
				Here are the two basic scenario when waterfall can be used:	
				</p>
				<h3>Small changes in mature product</h3>
				<p>
				Imagine a product that has been in use for 5 years. 
				If the customer wants to implement a small change, they probably have few superusers on site.
				These superusers were part of the product development and know it intimately.
				They know what they want and can define requirements very specifically and in a language which the supplier understands.
				Waterfall is the fastest and cheapest option.

				<h3>Requirements set in stone by other party than the customer or end user</h3>
				<p>
				Clear definition of  requirements is a painful process which generally speaking people are very happy to skip.
				In some cases the requirements has been set, e.g. in the case of legislation.
				Governmental organizations use software which supports the implementation of a law - imagine processing tax cards or any other application (in this case application means a form, a dossier).
				The work of these organizations is set by the law and so is the way the software should operate.
				Although the legal texts are hard to read, leave gray zones or are downright open for interpretation,
				there is usually someone among the law-makers, who can explain in clear language what the legal text actually says.
				These requirements do not change - unless the law changes.
				Face to face cooperation between the supplier, the customer and the law-makers is still very likely needed to keep everyone on the same page and get the specifications verified.

				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRINCE2" target="_blank">PRINCE 2 on Wikipedia </a><br>
				<a href="https://www.prince2.com/eur" target="_blank">PRINCE 2 website </a>		<br>	
				<p>
				PRINCE 2 is a brilliant methodology for big projects that need to be done right ... politics wise.
				Is there a chance that if you develop software in certain way, someone will want to stone you because, well, they feel they were not involved enough?
				Then this is the right tool to use.
				It was created for bureaucrats and fits perfectly environments which have more interested parties than just the supplier - customer - end user.
				Imagine for example software made for European Union, it has to serve well the needs of e.g. the European Commission, EU and non-EU companies, NGOs, local government representatives and general public.
				Better to get that right from the start.
				It includes lot of roles, special documents, working groups and meetings and can be effectively learned only by working in an organization that has already successfully implemented it.

				<p>
				Agile development has its place there, where the customer is not able to meaningfully articulate, what they actually want.
				Lets say customer sees chasm between themselves and their customers and asks for a bridge. 
				It is the suppliers job to find out that the customer is on Mars and a bridge may not be the best solution. 
				Agile development is done in increments.
				Simplifying it a lot here for the purpose of sticking to one paragraph - increment is a piece of work that is worth showing to the customer.
				The customer then has a chance to rethink what they want before the work continues.
